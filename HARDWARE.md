### recycled Hardware, listed price is at time of purchase
- Memory: Timetec Hynix IC 16GB Kit (2x8GB) DDR4 2133MHz PC4-17000 Non ECC Unbuffered 1.2V CL15 ~$123
- CPU cooler: Noctua NH-L9x65 ~$50
- PSU: EVGA 500W 100-W1-0500-KR ~$40

### Stuff I own for a while but still in their original package...
- SSD: Samsung V-NAND SSD 850 EVO 500G

   I didn't use the M.2 NVME SSD from the H270 for this build to avoid potential comparability issues.
- Storage: an old 500G WDC
- Case: NZXT S340

   I used a new case because the old case is too small and the PSU conflicts with the graphic card. I also need to reserve more space for the fenvi card which takes a PCIe slot.


### New purchase
- motherboard: ASUS TUF Z390-PLUS GAMING ~$170
- CPU: i5-9400 ~$210

   Initially I plan to follow [this guild](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/ck0c0d/build_i59400f_16gb_ram_asus_tuf_z390plus_gaming/) to do a budget build with i5-9400f since I know I will purchase a expensive graphic card. Right after I placed the order for i5-9400f. I know final cut pro and premier can utilize intel's iGPU for a technology named QuickSync which can speed up rendering video. So I cancel the order and got i5-9400 instead while not knowing if the CPU+MB combo still works out or not.

- GPU: Gigabyte Radeon Rx 5700 Xt Gaming OC ~$420
- BT Wifi combo card: fenvi T919 ~$60
